Milestone 2: Model Building

This branch contains all deliverables related to Milestone-2 and the associated datasets

1. Building a model architecture which can classify.
2. Trying different model architectures by researching state of the art for similar tasks.
3. Train the model
4. To deal with large training time, save the weights so that you can use them when training the model for the second time without starting from scratch.
