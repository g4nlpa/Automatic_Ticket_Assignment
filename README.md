Description of the file3 are as given below
 
All the models have been built on 3 differents kinds of data

a) Unaugmented data
 
b) Level 1 augmented data
 
c) Level 2 augmented data

1) Transformer_no_att_no_hyp  : Encoder-decoder(transformer) without attention and no hyperparameter tuning

2) Transformer_no_att_hyp     : Encoder-decoder(transformer) without attention and  hyperparameter tuning(learning rate and batch size)

3) Attention_no_hyp           : Encoder-decoder(transformer) with attention mechanism and no hyperparameter tuning

4) Attention_hyp              : Encoder-decoder(transformer) with attention mechanism and  hyperparameter tuning

5) cp_dl                      : Lstm,Bilstm,Gru and BiGru without hyperparameter tuning

6) cp_dl_hyp                  : Lstm,Bilstm,Gru and BiGru with hyperparameter tuning
