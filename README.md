 Description of the file3 are as given below
 
 All the models have been built on 3 differents kinds of data
 
 a)Unaugmented data
 
 b)Level 1 augmented data
 
 c)Level 2 augmented data

1)Transformer_no_att_no_hyp  : Encoder-decoder(transformer) without attention and no hyperparameter tuning

2)Transformer_no_att_hyp     : Encoder-decoder(transformer) without attention and  hyperparameter tuning(learning rate and batch size)

3)Attention_no_hyp           : Encoder-decoder(transformer) with attention mechanism and no hyperparameter tuning

4)Attention_hyp              : Encoder-decoder(transformer) with attention mechanism and  hyperparameter tuning

5)cp_dl                      : Lstm,Bilstm,Gru and BiGru without hyperparameter tuning

6)cp_dl_hyp                  : Lstm,Bilstm,Gru and BiGru with hyperparameter tuning
